you cannot cave into peer I had to make a personal decision for High school must be strong and make best for themselves and their Another pitfall in high school is that may become by the many in school and that may result in the student not the best and most To help with the pitfall that may occur in high I need to positive and seek the that will help me to do well and stay in should go to school and learn the school You should also do your homework and ask for help when should go to their guidance or their for help when I feel for You need learn important like for with the being responsible and to the These simple can help you to stay in do and home work so you can get good a good grade point average and meet all You should stay in so that you can graduate with good and then go on to further your Failure to in high school will result in poor poor If this you will not get good or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the Therefore it is important to stay in use the avoid the and make the best to stay in Evaluate a significant experience or that has special to to a different elementary school s every year or every other year always with that transition as a kid easy at all to make like birthday and people over were always difficult to set up because I have a group of base that I grew up Plus my are the type that they have to meet the for me to even come to a Imagine being eight old into a new elementary school not a face in the school with in your stomach how all to turnout That was me at least four different back in my elementary I would say the task was to try and fit Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only cookie in a fresh new pack of My did try and make it by all the and to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the Plus as a kid was very some would say so that help I even not to make because I knew I was to end up challenge I have away from the place I was in and the most of my life was very hard for me and my It was but at the same time to explore the new beginning of our My mind was that if I move away from all my one and I be able to see them again and afraid I be able to make any new in in the for what you for College is the next essential it is also the most about you finish high The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school know what they want to People their age know what they want to Myself I have spent what I would like to Anyone can say they want to do it some drive and execution to pursue something you There are many where I could have quit and people would have to see me At the end of all that I just had to why I was and was it worth To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a or I just had to stay and put all my essential to High School is a rough time for some are out what they want to become and out who they of change their at least most will change at least before they Not only what you want to do is out whom you are necessary as Why is this important as a college Many when they get to college have the hard work and will power to know what for them to be I have spent many on how to plan and make myself Someone once told me that a between and Anyone can listen but only some can It is the same concept on and someone who their I had before that told me that would not go The only thing the know was I did not take their into I kept myself from the wrong The I took were I did all I could and if I was behind I made up the I well and my I could have quit and not but I was because I had a goal to Hard work over anything I notice that hard work is like Everyone the that No how bad you are at something the amount of time practice an I have put so much hard work into That ready for a new challenge college is that next I have my whole life to get this With all the knowledge I have learn from and my high school practice college I am ready for With all the I have during my school and my life I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to new in an important transition in your It was my first year of high I was and nervous at the same time I was because it was a new beginning for It what significant to me because it was a big change for I was from middle school to high The alarm goes off it is now it is time for me to get ready for I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the The water was When I got out the I to my room and start The time flew by so I got ready on I had few before I had to go to the bus I ate some cereal before I left to bus stop I was with my I at the bus stop it was near the road where the were The wind was in my face because of the in the I could see the red on the The bus is near I start and my are I get on the bus and it as if I was into an oven it was we are near the school and I get I know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for We arrive at There are many there they yell out when they say that it to open the door and let us out of the Everyone off the bus and I am for my I get off the bus and start into the I walk in the school and there are of I am in between the I walk through everyone and it is time to look for my I think to myself I know where my are the good thing is that there were in each I got to all my I would look around to see if I had any in that I had at least one friend in each I just the day to be over as soon as The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell school is not The first day that bad because the only thing we do is get of what we will expect and our and what we will learn during the for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for The reason being is because I was already use to up later like around the year to wake up at was a I had to get use to up at that It was hard because the first I would wake up at the right time I would go back to I the bus a few I to get over that with The only thing I like is that I had seven The other thing was that the were very apart from each For I had to walk from one to another one in five I all my For me high school was easy as long as I did my They start us ready for the challenge you have face or expect to What is a something that you have to accomplish or something you have to Well everyone has Small big but I never thought I would face the one That is my dad I had no idea it was to happen that So the challenge I have to face in my It was so I have to My life has change since that It began on that I was out with my friend It was a great She left to go I went inside to my Then my got a call from my She told her that my dad had She came to my She told me and my sister that my dad has When I heard the bad where down my I had to call my brother to tell him the He and when I told He was like your lying like no It was grandma all We went to see him in the It was the thing I have to face to I almost fell to the ground and

out So I walk around and cry my When I was My was the people from church that my dad that And she also told them that I was the most about since my dad away my life change a All my ask me how you can live life still without your like I just think about as since then I been the same girl that I to My religious change and so has my for my dad death and for something else I Every time Something

and not like now the one I him to see me graduate and see I made He saw my brother graduate and now he see He would always tell me when he was me a Which to I that he would always say I would tell him no which say So my life has complete became a As can be seen life is so I want to live my Since my dad is no here I want him to know everything so I would be I want to become a and also an the only person that me on what I to do with my So when I become one of those of I own it all to my He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to Now not as much for his death because I know not And soon I would be with So this was the challenge I have to face and still What are the three specific you plan to do in The three specific I plan to do at is on and on to become a more responsible I want to build the best educate for Be known as one of the best student who came to To be known to on my of To be as an elite that the To be one of the best on and off the My focus is to

smooth road with the bright sun my I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for and food to live Then work go to the and give the that I wear any I would clean up the of to help the out with a place to claim for good and clean Evaluate a significant experience or that has a special to Many people have different in their Some have to get Other where able to go pro in a sport they There are a lot of that people have been able to A significant experience or that has a special to me is when I made it to Varsity The first time that I I saw that there were many good That me to try to be the best for the I practice every day and gave it all I But one of my that was me from being the best was my knee My knee pain was bad and that was me down big Therefore my sophomore season the I able to become the best for I did therapy for my knee and I my I went back to But this time I did something different that I dint do the first I went to summer Summer me out big time to become and achieve my I ran all summer long with the I any knee summer our season I was to achieve my goal that Two into the season and we had our first race of the an for a mile race I knew I was on track to my I kept hard to get even and by the time you know it I was top varsity for High I that year with my best time of This year I am a new That goal is to beat my personal that I set last to put even more work in and to try more hard to achieve that I know that I focus on my goal be able to reach The goal I am for this season it to run a flat or less if My main goal that I had was been to become a varsity That goal has been now I have to set new so I can keep in A new goal I have is to beat my personal of and get a the that has a special to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for High a significant experience or that that has special to One of the is to graduate and fulfill all the and that I have set for This world is full of people that had set and but never did anything to make them come I want to be one more of those people that do anything to not make I will do whatever it just to make it I want these not only for myself but I part for my They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their Why do I say that I only want it for me but for my my family has been there for me without about it they have had my no what they will always be They push me to do my very best all the and tell me every time that I should never stop for what I if I want it to go for Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me I know because they By me and would be the best not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be my and for all of those people that have faith in me or never believe that I could have done I want to give the best I have and be My mother is one thing that push me the most to do and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do and by that I will be her back a little out of all that she has gave That is the main that I have in the one that is to take me far in life the one that to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by with hard effort but I made Everybody is born with a purpose in I know Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it to get it of a place you know Describe the place and include about Have you to go back in and visit that one place that a smile to your Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your and on the other hand close to your When I think of that place I only imagine There are three in that I which are in some very different and similar at the same is one of these that I adore to stay at the fact that my was born around this Also her and my still live there to this Every time I go spend time over there I fancy through the high of green corn and lost for with my little cousin Another thing by is the breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose appear throughout by were even my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and bread on the side to make the experience even more I forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby in a circle and them with a few we would lift that something and the would run in every The place was to collect each one of the until we got ten This specific moment made me feel and inside my Every single time I go to visit the moment is pleasant and My heart up every time I am able to go to Another place in to spend time at is is near the three from the city but a hot sweaty three in the My little brother there in a two story I love there because I get to share with my baby I once my sister and I went to a water park like thirty My almost out of my head once I saw the price of each Each one of us had to pay one hundred which is the name of the in In it would vary from fourteen to fifteen The money me at the end of the I saw huge slide with people and The one ride that is to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were in a giant slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell My heart was the entire time we were the water park we back to my house where we ate a fish that was whole and at This to make my stomach to move from the smile on my a few my other my came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to My live the to the one and a half The part of is that always there and I love the sun against my I adore out in my store where he The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I his store as What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I that the only thing to do at their At I would help my grandma water all her such as A person that who has had a significant influence on and describe that They say Judge A book by Cover but why everyone still judge me because of the I want to take or the job I would love to People are always me what to do and what is best for but I want what happen to my cousin to I want to be a and I will be because I have the for My cousin always to travel the but her never let her do what she to do with her since they were the who were her college and her People and family would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were She knew that one day she was to be to many and the sent a to her school for a voluntary to go to out the country and help When everyone doubt it she always in From the time I was able to that the was the best for me and my I decide to do my on Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on and describe that Through out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been When i was sick like i was on my death was When i just need someone to talk to or a friend she was always That person is my My mother has made the influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this Throughout all the struggle me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave and fought through it She was my My name is Lewis She is a Practical or and she is on her degree Born in to the when she was and has and her family was a military family with her dad in the One reason i chose her to be my influence on me is the fact she was always there for when i was from Elementary to Middle school I had a hard time and had of with me being and my constant stutter did not make it any from my point of It just gave more ammo to fire at me day day and i with But i always knew i could come home and wait to o'clock the time she off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best She was always on my side and when i stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at in the an important transition in your My name was not to participate in the three day soccer The coach do not have your on but yet I mine in to the lady soccer and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week The coach told me to ask Coach the Varsity to see if I can still When I over to and him on the he me up and down at how I was I am new to the soccer world so I had black and two that day was the day it to and he if it is not on file then I will not let you I was for just in the cold from to Being told in front of the whole soccer team and new that you is and it I knew I in my Form but they not have Later on that day of the my Coach and him that I did turn it in to the Soccer So the Coach that I am able to come to the second day and I will be during the I told my I will not go to the because I will feel the pressure and know they are me I also did not want not meet their and still not make the I did not have much experience to the game of so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my for the game till next So from the day the second I was soccer left and on ball my and at on my I have a lot from the I am glad that I to go off and improve my I am more confident to but still will be nervous and feel the I my last year of

few in for New New City Red and LA In will have their own I would like to try them out So since that day I have my mind to more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is Discuss What You for This Position Not everyone is for every job or I know I have the potential to be a police the blue is not the or most popular position right now but I am to do the dream is the first step to a certain is also key to success in specific I am very perceptive so I can notice that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this I can see myself right now in the uniform and out across the Perception is a necessary skill for all law Without would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the If a I will I know the of being under the influence of hard will not fool me I will note the delay and in a response and the many that accompany Then I will ask for the There is another sense that is for this A sense of justice is a key component to the The privilege of other people can Many act as if they are the of the land but I would consider myself a servant of power is to There are who accept and practice I would treat all as not the a or any particular This country is on of and should be by only the require a certain set of that want to be police are out first for the I have astute to notice illegal and abnormal and I also have a clear sense of I know I will pass the and perform well in the In the not too distant I will assist in the the the people in I was born in When I was about five old my mother some people and in up was a real were paid there was no for me and my and we would to a different This several until money was no an issue and we into a

everything all the with no even my mother there time went It us life can be gone in a blink of an that it made us and as a It made us strive to get everything we and once had because we lost it all in one It me that I need an to be successful in order to get everything I The we take from failure can be fundamental to later an incident or time when you How did it affect and what did you learn from the High school is a great ground for young to experience freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work Everyone but up to you to correct them and the is a huge thing to You always have to stay and on top of My freshmen year in high school I second semester I know how I was to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at I went to my counselor to ask her about any that the school for that She me a chance to do a Credit The was for two and class was to do Credit Recovery for those two I still had to say on top of my for school and Me Biology set me back but also made me how much school Is important to me and just how I stay and do the right Freedom can help or set you back in up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what to For example to go out with your instead of for a I Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on and describe that From a young age my were always on my butt to go in a straight to stay and to never do something I would regret in the My always had a huge influence in my To this day I can never be any more grateful to have The example they set is the example I want to set to the From in the to they would come with written all over their Just their just so I can go to school and I have to worry about Because of them I want to strive for I want to be someone with a degree or a business just something that they could be proud I was given an that given to my and that was an face where out was the easy way but why quit when so close to a why quit on something my would be so happy why let them why not graduate so they can tell their and family that they a successful a kid that give My would tell me if you want to be successful go for we would be by your nothing you from being someone important in my senior year and crazy to think that I made it this the only one in my family about to a curse been in my family for My are the reason for me to finish my Every day I would get about what kind of life I would have if I finish high I want to be behind a lawn a day in the an open so many for different in the Discuss the challenge you have or expect to face Everyone has a challenge that they expect to My challenge that I expect to face is to college and being successful in the Those are my challenge because it is not to be I am to have to put a lot of effort and not mess Once you mess up it is very hard to get back and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that It is not to be easy because do not just accept They require much information such as the SAT or the Which are a test that every college and you have to meet the average point or Also a certain point of and resume and other important College is the real it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to To be successful in my future I have to do something I and that me good money for I want to do because I want to have my own I do not like it when people boss me Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one people around and they would work for I that because it something I like to do and I have always to have my own In college I want to study but it would not be Even though it would not be easy I would not give it would be a great challenge for College is the time to get your together and start extra It is not to be easy but one should not give It would be stressful and hard but that is just how college I am the type of person that so I attention in college with no would be a I would have to set up and learn how to accomplish each one of When you set up you have to be and find a way to achieve It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to The challenge I am to As a child I had almost everything to What I would ask for I I had six for out As time what I when I so easy Now my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is the last first day of high school I am struck with as soon as I walk through those double to myself wait to graduate and get this year over By May all of this will be over and be left to my own by May all my would have on be stuck to my self By May my time would be Discuss a place that has a shame how few people choose not to go to I plan on to college and have a bright One particular school been is I plan on a school with a positive and fair I have unique history and about the school as Not too long ago I College my sophomore I was in this we went on a field trip to visit the This experience I off that rusty bus into the quiet The were silent and every step you The lunch room like a I said to love to attend this As soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then to a student that He told us the which was a at the He is a black We were also that was an This was a shock to many The crazy thing was College was right across the street from was an The student us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere The best part about our tour was up The student us with unique history of the There is an obelisk in of was an and civil He was a graduate of There were many other that from this school such as Spike and Martin King Martin King was at more at the age of the These unique went on and on like a broken since the tour never been the I met the to this I would be more than happy to attend I hope school high school to tour this It is truly a life Discuss the challenge you have or expect to Throughout my entire life have been with me from the No what I have and been to face more that are thrown my Without with these in life I think I would be as successful as I am to me are to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to Plus how to never give up and stay at the task at The challenge I expect to face in life is my and brother a house and a lifestyle for I expect to do all that through basketball as a of fact and I have a great that I will be able to accomplish this as Basketball is my wife in this world because I have become so phenomenal at it that I have been and The only reason for me even to play is because my little brother up to me and he to see me make it big for the In the future as I finish up high I expect to have well enough to be ready for college and that I will be in that as I already know that for me will forever come my way but as a humble human being I will never to always push myself to get at what I love and something I always to The other challenge I expect to face is to find the college right for me and on how great of a school they are wise and I have any basketball or any other athlete can dream My have been North or State of and pretty much For me those it took a lot of hard work to get there and not even wise Those expect major from and I can get lazy so it will take me some time to bypass all of A college I was to was State With that being a school in the country they acquire to be For me to get in there I have to do well in high school as of now since a Because if I loiter around in my freshman and sophomore I have to worry about much as a But that is a challenge I am at this moment and I know I can people are here to support me as I continue on with the success at I know be That is the challenge I have in my life because there were to where I just to give up and stop basketball all But I had to come to my intellectual gift and do what I what to do as my heart Another Challenge I expect to face is my and forth the effort as I am told to do But I have that already but if I want to get in a successful college at this moment of life I got to just get through Another college I was forward to to see was I to consider them on my list because their high school as major as and so But it will still be a big obstacle for me to get Plus their have to meet my because I want to attend if they as good as I But there are a lot of in my and as a of So it me I have to face a colossal obstacle at The high way a never of concrete and My dire and tit on the old my first day on the I stop pull over and scream not in anguish but it in nervous over my future I was to to some no surprise to My interest and my and some family I to become a something never herd of by my up in a wall much greater than in the not racial not was a wall my wall from the time I could I had trouble with not on the page but in my I could read and with the best of them but the second I was told to write my mind went a blank

can help out my A Personal or issue that is important to you The distribution of wealth in is one of the to me on a personal level and is a big problem on a level Economic seem like a in this country with the lopsided balance of wealth in this have been done of all different and economic status and most thought that the distribution of wealth in was a lot than in what it There are a lot of people in out of work and not their financial and that I see as a big problem the could be to where everyone can Now I see wealth being there would be no drive to work and achieve and make more I do believe that the gap between how much the the middle class and poor people make is way too of this wealth go to the top That those big like bill of the whole wealth goes to those The average these get paid is more than there average employee and in the fast food over Now sure these work very hard for their money but very hard to believe that they are or even than their Also the of own of the nation There are so many people on food and other of this You have people with and find that pay well enough to provide for their and There are in this country who struggle to make meet and very few rich but yet the ratio of how much they make versus of is There is also a big reason why the rich make so much more money than the poor people are of this and just to get by in The poor and middle class a lot of do not educate themselves to this and it as the rich care more they want to keep all the money there If we want to make money and solve this problem we have to wake up and on with our and demand a distribution of the wealth in this A good lawyer can the be the factor in a A great example that many people have heard was is the Many people thought that he commit the Most of the proof to the crime he was did point to however brought the bet money could With his he was found not guilty which many I do not care if was or was not guilty however his case did teach me the of a good When I was a boy my brother was for later they found the real but he spent two on the When I found out he was guilty I felt my My family could not afford a very good lawyer and we had to use a family My mother said that was an okay lawyer but the prosecutor was like the god of My would not let me attend the trail I had to grind my teeth or I would yell at the top of my When my brother was many of my own family he was That my belief that a lawyer has the power to win any why I want to be lawyer to make sure the right people are If a lawyer is good enough he can be the main factor in a Even with all the like the a lawyer can still win your A convince judge or jury that a man is guilty or that is why I want to be a the I read about the case I a light off went in my I saw that could help a lot people by just being their I know now that there is a lot to being a lawyer but I still want to help people by being their Something else I found out about lawyer is that many people could not afford the good I plan on a lot of pro I want to help everyone I believe to be Many people who cannot afford a good lawyer and are found guilty and have a however people of wealth get off quite easy because the can afford There are many of the rich off easy the is every for some another but they can afford the best I believe many big can sell harmful food or their not because they bribe but because they get the best they can buy to convince the that everything is Those I not only want to be a lawyer but I want to start my own because many abuse their of persuasion for My firm will be about help people who afford a good lawyer and of course those who can because I need to make a I will try to be the best lawyer I can be so no one has to watch their innocent brother go to challenge I have to grow up

she did the best she Describe an important transition in your life Imagine up one to the sound of the last to wake up but that anyone with the amount of throughout the entire I downstairs to the kitchen on and seeing my family around the Without them even a word I already knew what was I myself for what I was about to hear but not enough in the world to prepare yourself to hear that your home to be your home of in the same house and this place like the back of my hand and as what was once the little tree our house grow every or the progression of the fresh black concrete fade as the went by to a dry grey all of this house to be This was the same house I to ride a bike where I met my best friend the first day we here from when I was only where I had my birthday where I the most important in my go more than day came and I as each room in our house became it was almost as if we were never It was an Although a part of me was hurt I had to push my to the side and be a support system for my I did not let them know how I was about the whole and just my best to uplift their I want them to feel in anyway guilty because I knew well that everything was done that could have been done to try to keep our I was grateful to them because although we were in a tight money wise they every penny they had and still to give our family a nice house to live a beautiful place a town wood with white The first time I into this house I felt like because I knew there was no back to my old of and my old I change should always be No how difficult the might or how go may seem to you at the moment you always have to make sure that you use your time what I This might not seem like the most tragic thing in the and because This transition alone though taught me to every second of what I have while I have it because you never know if the next day wake up and it be there for you I to take advantage of my time because you can never go This is a lesson everyone should learn in their I know a thing to say but I never found the true of this until I it Time is everything and you get as to when it will be by this everyday but never it like I do You need to everything till the last bit of my house was an awful point in time for our but we from This made us learn to value everything in our to a further This was a lesson well and well The challenge that I expect to face so since about my challenge I thought about but I I cannot think of So I to just write about the challenge that I am now in my senior year of high So this is the challenge I have So come with me in this challenge and image what So one day my had me in to his office and had me what my So I saw it and I and thought to Am I to graduate with my senior class in May But first for me to do I need to go through some in order to And believe me a lot of So the I need to do are So what I need to do Pass all the I have this semester and next I have to do credit recovery this semester and next Do or from a different place like faith and a different place that which I Pass all of those in those and then I need of the foreign or technology class of And this is a lot to do on my And not to mention a lot of money for all So this year I got to step up my game a lot on my If I want to pass and graduate next year This right here had got put to the top of this list of But anyway let me continue on When I had got home and told my and dad what I to We up what I can do and how much everything is to be and I can tell u right now not to be cheap at When I was to my and he was me a lot of I need to His face look like a good He told me that it would be a lot of work for me and was me to just finish it next year in And he was that it be cheap because of where I had to take So I said and that I was to go ahead and try The reason y this is a big challenge for me is because of what my said when I had left his He said and I quote that it was to be hard and he told me that not impossible but he say it was So when he said that I said to myself this is a big challenge for me do I And in my head I said I do challenge So now this will be the challenge I have Now let me see if I can compete this challenge or is it to be a Never know till I You have been President of the write your speech for my fellow of the of As your new I would like to share my and I have in mind to put our country in a positive before I would like to thank the of for me their new President and me a chance to our I have a speech for you a speech to demonstrate my or for this country of all face is upside Our war on has been on for a bit and our previous president has done NOTHING to get us out of the instead he his and made But my goal on the other hand is to bring our home and end the conflict with simply by them talk is cheap serious to be Now have this country so now I will say I will give you my word will no be an issue for the I would like to address the welfare it has gotten out of Most people on welfare get money every without even an attempt to get a job or make something of nice to know where my tax are along with many other But now that in office that will The welfare policy will be if you sign up for welfare and you have a job you have to find a job and be or else if you complete the you be for welfare and have to wait year before you can try You only get for every which should be great because you will have a job if on I would like to address the of and how some people have their opinion that police are to and they are to Police do their they risk their to save If not in the first hand with the subject you have no right to share your on what you think the cop is because when it all down to it you will need them before they need So with that being said I will change the law to if you fail to cooperate and listen to the cop by the first you simply need to be taken in because you to listen and follow and it would be a fine for Failure to follow In here to create a future for everything and But most make a future for our The of With that being said expect and thank you for me as your can be helpful or they can be Either a good stress that you to do your very best or the bad kind that can lead to health and bring you Either way it help if we like what the My challenge is right what college to go There are many different that I can apply Most of the I even know the name or where they are I want to be a high school art I most have of with a major in and art as my I thought that it that art would be my major and would be my I was born in so it would be good to find because I already know the is my second it is where I am and where I most be for another There are two school that me and has class that I would have to go but u has which is way more convenient for me that I am no in at the I might miss out on the experience of campus seem a lot less of a Now that I have chosen the that I am most in I have to make a plan of I must first look at the and see if I meet Then I must make sure I have a place to stay for which school I end up to whether with a with a or even an Either way it goes I will need to get a job that will allow me to study and attend Another challenge that would go along with this is that and are very different In I feel like a car is a most have thing most of the and are When I in I and my to almost every store and the were never further then away from where I it was great and we never In in the north it I to roll in the snow as a child and was that month for me because I love when the temperature is below In I hate here it never and the temperature even go below too hot if I do end up to a college in it will have been my last possible My challenge was what college to go Now that I have at the and the to or here in I that is where I already there for most of my life and family close by it would also be the smart has but the over way This challenge has my life in a good I the way that it made me think about what I want to do with my life high school it gave me another That is to get in the college that I want to go The Person Who Me The Most The women who took care of me for always told something that you love and not something for the love of My has been and always will be my one She was the person who me to be in She was the one who me to strive to be someone that I would be happy about down the My is the reason for I always knew was something I and to do for a very long I can the first time I I woke up one bold and in one of my out her purse that felt like a Being only in I had no idea what I was seen my put on her bright lipstick and her neutral eye shadow with before and it just me about to be like I was that my would catch but I wait to ask I only mascara on one eye and left to school like Throughout the I went through some pretty bad My first year of middle school I I a new a new I off my My nest of hair like I my and when I cut My seventh year any I to watch a lot of on the So I to experiment on picture I see these on that made any eye look just I to do what they I this flamingo bright pink on my with some lipstick that like a basket of red I know how I All those and my always told me that practice As I grew and my to be a never While everyone to be a or even a zoo I to dedicate my life on other people feel good about been told that a a job a hundred that at some point I to believe My is the one who it a My passion for hair and beauty is I made sure I got ahead on my high school to attend Maxwell and start My goal one day high school and later up school is to open up a business over in I know the bar high on this one but to for it and to My me to do this and make it happen at whatever all the support I need to make this My me to aim high but walk through to School is the first step on my Being to this school would be an and privilege to attend This school is everything I is every future The I would have to face are to be worth every sweat and tear being a student This is where I set foot of my Through this I will be become the person long to be and I know my would be so proud to call me her Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on and describe that Role we all them or at least someone we look up too weather that person is real or I have several role but the main one that I can say has had the influence on me is the dark night back I the old series and just he was Since then he was already a part of my life but it until the of middle school when he To begin I a very social person most throughout my More or less due to the fact that I had terrible because of previous with in elementary To worsen I was already a shy person and my face would always turn tomato red and my would start to get moist every time I would get on to answer a question or even do something simple like to talk to the As by got worse and they any as time Thus my entire on and such I got into the character This is because of the entire that would pass on they all were extrovert of people and was the complete He was he play and had no in addition to the fact that even some fear All that though He would still carry his duty and protect the people of So what to happen was that I found myself to person or In it made start up for Because I could now be myself and not feel down about the way I If could be serious and scary to people but yet a hero at the same why not maybe not a but at least out there my business without what people as the to pass I would just feel and about It got to the point that it would show through my just everything that I was indeed more with So By the time of high school I was a different I was more out people would approach me and not say that were of me or Everything was great but then took a slight Those that I had with in elementary school were to as Everything was still all well until I would see them or they would have the same class as I would just feel a huge explosion go off in my chest and my head got hot and my mood would just change for the worst in a The reason for that was that I forgive them for what they had done to me This experience or event however let me to be able to to a little more in the sense of To begin I that no what any villain did or how corrupt and psycho that person he never once hurt an enemy to the point that they were in the hospital or Instead he would warn them before he did anything and if they listen then he would take From all that what I took in was that he forgave the bad for himself to be the person and not give into a bad path where he would end up being the same or no than the people he Thus I that and to forgive all my and such and just be the person and carry on with my In so I was able to finish high school and carry on with the world and with ease all to my one I feel like my heart just to the floor and I am to pick it back My were at the end of the board all I had to do now was to take my and do my Every step I took I felt like the board was and and I be able to reach it but at last I was at the end and you believe I was that board like it was my life on the me off like a cannon ball I did my dive and I went into the water like a fish no splash at Being in the water felt peaceful like if it was another world I could hear people and like over a piece of meat as I arose to the surface I could hear the from the they thought it was a good out of the water that I was done felt great my heart was no on that board it was right back in my rib that it was my first meet I thought I did pretty good at my team from a far I could see them up and down and and to them made my smile stretch all the way up to the of my I was happy because that I made them proud gave me great joy in seeing to the bench where my team was at felt like I was to home from a long I had taken a seat to rest and to think about on how did I began to that I had come so far to be at this A short woman with big white hair had to rally up a commotion about me to my I felt a on my shoulder from someone my attention I around to acknowledge the person and it out to be the women with big at me with her big I knew she had some to tell me and it was good The past make you your and to not get by it by My life has been in many as I grew up when I was old and came to the in the year of I thought my life would be such a hurricane due to what had in my family with my own mother and led to the way of with my Family is very important in our Family you on you how much someone can fail them and family are people that are always there for you you with important such as your or what type of pathway you will choose when into People in the world do not how much impact they can cause into life either for or for bad such as into depression or to make them even as a Fairy exist maybe in and but not in real life where many broken with will be some end with a A couple of had by since I from to A lot of were on in my one with my mother who was being strange all the who at made her own feel like the only mother they had was their grandmother and A few my brother and I were until we saw our mother by with a bag that was full of her and my little She had told us that she was to sale those or donate them but who could of thought what she said was all a and a couple of went by no type of was my left with my little until it was my little birthday party was when I got to see my little sister and this time would be for Someone I did not see was my have come by and there was no done with Almost have come by with no word being heard from the person that gave me I forgot who my mother how she like and her way of All I was that I had a mother who just care about her own or them without about how much they will end up her throughout the During those of life for I fell into depression where all I to do was commit suicide simply because seeing my with both their made me jealous and feel I always of perfect who would last forever and be an example for their own Fairy end with happy you have to create your own beginning by people that will help you and never give up on you and end up with a happy The to go on until I was My brother was into his last year of high school my family was apart My father had it very tough with my grandma and He had two in which he got paid well but that money enough for the that to be Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on and describe that Did you had that when Or that moment when you just want to give Or that when stuck and know how to get out of the I a ton and I feel like the only one with when I need help but

other people can show important to and what you care My has been very about my and for the She has sat down with me and me about my future and she to what I have to She also me advice on how I be to insecure on what other people say about me and always do my best at whatever it This has taught me that I am fortunate to have a who because not everyone is fortunate to have who support you on your high In my has been the person I admire the she has me in many the She has taught me that it is important to be because hard work Also that a positive mind set can lead to new Also that support in your life can help you Discuss what you for this The reason why I should work at or any other shoe because I have the potential for with and also an excellent I want this because I can help support my pay some and help my family with the and also make her To be honest I think that at is to be an easy task to do because once a in the store greet them with respect and let them find some that they are and if I see them struggle then walk up to them and ask them if they need any help or any that they are at in There are to be some and that to have when I work and my are the with a them if they need any to the back room and to get their shoe size and then to the and them up My are the type of that they want that will be for them and also seeing which shoe will be in style for and but I can manage to get to that by and them up to get real with them up with I feel like that I can be way than the other that to be with because once a in and ask one of my that they are for some that they can play basketball in and then to be like I know what then that is when I come in and be like I know the perfect that can be fit for you when you play then I walk over to that section and show them and then they are to say hey I like then I ring them up and tell them to have a nice day and come back and see us Another reason is that very and very nice when it to to people and also very for example if you come up to me and ask me a question I am to say sure I can help you with something and then walk over there and see what the help with and then once they ask me that they need a shoe to go and get the thing to measure their foot to see what size I need to Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on and describe that Is there a person who significant influence on Like your your and your

people and began to love This was something that hit me like a fast ball and it was something that me Heart Nothing was more important than this I gave all my focus in to my cousin as she which hand the in penny was My and body inside and out as she somehow to pick the right hand Me envious to change it up and do anything so that my cousin The first thing that came to my head was that I should hide the penny in my but I only had on my non jean dress and I had no to hide them there so that was out of the The last and most secure place to me to hide the penny was in my warm moist At the time this like a very intelligent Until my cousin chose a empty hand and I up my mouth and me still being the jealous person that I am I never her to even see the penny again so I had made a decision that well thought I When it I could taste the go half way down my It so fast that I that I had done something Chorus Room Who am I always that question to I that a different person then I was three When I view myself in the mirror I see all the misery that once took a place in I a different someone who is and at peace within their I only found this new conception because of a chorus High School out all my the moment I down the street at to get to the bus stop on I at this huge contraption at As I in apprehensive and insecure seeing all the different of I found myself to find a familiar face to but instead I to my first class of a new In first period at white and too timid to try and make conversation to new in some old and I was so to see them and start to make And soon it was time for Chorus up being my safe A place where I could be myself and no one could judge I met all kind of different people and two of them became my best They brought me out my shell and this new person that is here The High School Chorus Room my life I never was in a place where I felt so and felt like I I always had to hide who I was because the fear of being by But I I was for all my something that High School High School out all but The Chorus Room made me embrace my It was the best thing that could happen to I grew and grew into a person you even three by my maybe a not by the way I or or even the way I But by how jubilant I was how nothing me even Discuss the challenge you have or expect to People face a lot of different throughout their Some are able it to make it through and just quit and fall Well I am not a I have before and if I have to go through that I am sure that I will The person that has the most influence on me in life is or you can say one of the people I like my backbone that me so many different thing I have from him and I look up to my because he goes out to work every day to provide and help my and I can tell year round is not but you got to do what you got to taught me how to not waist money on other people to do the same thing I can no where be without He me to not be dependent on and different to make money the clean He me to many different that I know for a fact I be without him We hang out more as best more than farther than Year round we are and our During fall and winter we and in the summer time only I because not too good at it like I the one that taught me most of the of life that I The top two of them is day is a new and from live for and hope for I think about what if I wake up one and not there and I wake up that I hear the from my job since that moment forward I that to go to college that I be able to work at a fast food like Pizza In there are you have to change to be a person in your In this I want to work at a place where I would be around in a way that I felt I have many different to the point where I feel that I be someone treat me this to this job that I need to work hard to get easy In other I need to go to college and face another hard challenge to get to where I can make easy money and not have to deal with people me however they As a young you want to make your own money to get your own In high school you face many and in which you you need to be more dependent on yourself then your Now as a senior I have worth this long way and all I had to do to get where I am I am thankful for everyone that has me along the way and has me to keep When I first my family me me if I like the job because if I did it would mean I easy money in a way that In other it would not be right that I would work so hard to get so little are many in the world that can change a It could be a church or a certain place that you It all can affect you from the way that they to the Future you One place in many can to is One place that I may Say has me is the football This place in many has me to become a To begin being on the football field alone up good and One way that it has me to be a is to always work A that has always been every time I suit and walk on to the football For one memory that to mind is the very first time I step foot on the I could it like it was It was a and hot as The sweat down into my where it began to burn with no chance of it at Then the coach for I could not have taken another second of My began to tremble under the weight of my but then one of the head me aside and told me you got this just keep and the pain of today will be your gain I believe that you will go since then have always In It was a warm sunny fall It was a tough very stressful decision to a to attend next This experience has shown me that tough to make a decision without your a In what could affect you as you transition into your next phase in from different is very Just to know that they are and you just so you can come to their college is very Seeing your face turn bloodshot because she is of all the college will go to war with each other so they can lure you in to come on their Discuss what make you for this my career is one of the best I have Because as a kid I that were it may very easy But Meanwhile at the while two are the may seem a little But the fact that it can damage their brain in a long However hard to believe us not forget that is still one of the best that was during ancient and Since I was year old I I use to watch it a I like that involve Meanwhile I am new to of the other there was an family that that just to My family knew them However one day I was a match and he saw me me if I want to join a Well he was a great in had won a lot of trophy and and the next day he me to the gym and my However know that he knew I and how I take it He that he will train me very and he take it easy on for some reason I love his idea about me very there are two different of in this One that it serious just like his or her On the second hand there people who for the time or the Well to me a sport for money is stupid However people in world that it for the money or to kill But however to me as always been my and my It was in The sky was still While we were in to coach said today is a big day for we arrive in the gym Saw couple of there and couple of It was a big day for was my first The first round went very well however during round my were was hard for me to I was stuck in a However every time I would try to clinch on He would throw a jab and Which was hard for me stay on He would try to me but it Now that round nine was over my coach told me this is the round that I have to go full Because we take the risk of all twelve So the round and I was dizzy I was like I was But I got caught with a hook and he put into his And he a lot of meanwhile I was for him to do a single and He very We still had a minute left on the Well he drop his and my was fast I duck down and him twice and I throw a right hook which made him off balance that point it was my turn so I throw many and my last punch And I won the Everybody that is an easy not it take time to build speed and power From that point on I learn my lesson no to wait for opponent to attack I should always start To has always been part of my To me is like a best friend beside to is just a but to me is not just my my I have plenty of but the most important one that I expect to face is to I just think of myself everyday of where I will be in the College is one of the most important in life because without college to stay paid an College is a must have I see people every day because they went to I think that everyone should go to college if they want to be People that go to college great different then everyone else because people know that they are to be successful people in The other people that go to college get like For I know my cousin that work at a mall and they were him because he have a high school You want to be like my cousin because even if someone you if you you will feel to say why important to go to school and do what you have to do to get that About in that high school football of those receive division to of those that make it to college go to the next level and the and most of them make the Well one of those that is against the to be able to earn a college a tough challenge that I have to face my senior and I have no and only one way Year year the sound of a off and and but not from the people beside you nor behind but across the field of grass another team has you The of This is the year that not to happen again and I let that happen to the underclassmen who are the future of our The definition of is to arouse of or effort to stimulate the quality or full use of and One of the that I am right now is high Why is high school my challenge you might Well simple what to do with your life high what and what All can take a lot and put stress on My challenge is to finish high school and decide what to do with my For some of you who do not High school is not what you expect it to be the felt like an commute home on the The school lunch can only be as a ago Every day you home Some I would come home not anything at I would always question The part about a high school life is to get past the you face to class in the traffic my pace my muscle and all to do Walk through the So much work just to walk in the Why it is that people like to hang out at the No common are meant for not and it while people try to push their Out of all the little I face one challenge still What would I do high of high school I can still not make up my There are many but I cannot pick which is the best for What college should I go what field should I do what about the All the I want to answer but simply In I am my best to figure out what to do with my life high I do not know whether I am to which college or if I am to attend the Whatever in the future will happen on my this all what is the point of a challenge if it make you try your Discuss a place that has you Have you been told that the whole point of life is to live with the of the bad It only a place and a wrong decision to change your life around and your future To me it all around the end of the school year of senior I was a year old girl High I to drop out of high school to have a job and depend on myself because of family I had a sick dad who got fire and a who only work part My only choice was to help and hold down my out of high school is an issue face by many today me There are many to drop out of school but with those come many Out of those I learn that school is important and future as so our career School was a waste of time for I had zero sure school is a huge benefit if you are But it only was me angry and I never thought I would drop out of high I I love being and the when I was in elementary school to middle they in bad I was very hurt and felt like I was for not being able to continue my I was committed to demonstrate to my family and that I was that one person with and the crowd me while I walk to receive my A lot of those people were at I felt like I was the definition of a high school At that point I to help my family out since money was around that I told my dad my decision and he agree he said he I want to help them out but he told me I had to promise I will come back to school and As a teen I just want the best for me and my future family so of course I will be a high school graduate and a collage graduate as There are many why any dropout school is not for them as many people say now I was once one of I kept myself that I graduate on time I was already All those made me not believe in me I I care about school I care about my not even the I was good At the end of the year I to drop out what the point of to is when I was already them I kept Until the day came when I to not go to school and be welcome to the real life a job and on During that time I was to find a I felt like nobody was there for Everybody was still to school to finish what I finish my junior I felt left behind alone and until I met a friend who as a I told her what was on and if she could help me find a place to work at her they hire me at her job at that point I was happy and felt like everything was I every day from I got home I to give up but I would have felt like a until I how hard and stressful is to To you it was my first job at age I the job I knew this for me when I and open my and told myself what was I I rather to be at school then somewhere I summer came I to go to summer school and finish some I was still manage to go to Then The smell of salt in the air and women in all around What would you think your The beach of course a place where most would spend spring break at or for just This place I know well is Myrtle just place I I do have for this place I spend much time their but I have somewhere in my heart I could not To start off why this place

place is where I can find Every year I go visit I feel like an eagle throw the blue My heart to race every time my family and I go Every year we go visit my it me that family is what in The first year I my home town was when I was ten We had left the house around two in the on a That night my and dad where ready with the luggage and everything in my ford My brother and sister had up when I in there room and told them to get ready so we could While my brother and sister to get my to look for our while my dad the truck for anything that might cause a problem with my and dad had done everything they to do we off on the My brother and sister half asleep in the truck my and dad as Me on the other my heart was still and just with joy My dad and it would take us one full day and three more just to get to the My and dad drive and I also them out a little as the long drive we the border and there were a lot of people The line to cross the border was very more than the down town traffic is on a game the we spent at the border we were ready to hit the road It was my turn to drive pulse he was the only one that know the way to get there without the long way like last Three specific about me is I like because you can learn so much about in some many So I want to go to college get my major in history and might become a on Another specific thing about me is that a hard I ask we and always

the only person that play high school But I still play So I hope that you let me in your to sport and be a positive student in Also to accomplish my I set while Trump to beat everyone in but where he stand in the all he has been about is that were not their not not people that have of and those with and I are good and bring infectious to the which is not not just that but because he is as he in rich and not not I care and us to believe that to a place when he to hurt people and and care about other other than the legal people whom to him do not make or are not As many people have heard Trump is with as head in miss as soon as this pageant he that he is not because of a in his When in he is just to make an honest buck out of that to be the industry and the network him and ask him you regret the at all had I said people from all over the much are you them them for a tremendous amount of money for when the person who should be for is him for people from the middle east and people are our country The real question is do we want a guy to run for He can hold his tongue when his turn to just common sense as a even a child they know when they are permitted to speak and when they should start and how without being rude if you ask me I believe trump was a child and still is today get it wrong he has good but I still feel he be given such a power when his idea of respect is as ideal as a three year old Who is someone you look up to and There are many different people that come in and out of your All of them teach you different Some come in to teach you how to and just to mess your life Many of the people that stay are the who love you and the you learn to The very two first people that will teach you everything are your My prime example is my My dad is a pain in the neck when it to my and school always on my back when he home from get off your not you I always seem to make the same dumb by yeah dad I did that he always my He is such a like not even the My dad is also always about my Like any other parent he into a loud parakeet and at me if I have a bad but never he hit me for any My dad has taught me the most in When he was only fifteen he was in the army back in El one year he to run away from the military and flee his When he to the his told him he had to because she have enough money for the both of My dad has been independent He always me how I should value my life and that I should appreciate that I have both my With my dad I can play around but also me when time to be My dad is like my He always me about how I do a lot of the he because he want to see me like he This man has always been there for Blood is than water they and my dad has that to never a time I like out to work with my taught me so much of the he Always that when he he me to be known the way he My dad has never given me a bad he may drink and stuff but he always to do it behind our so we see never us anything and even though he you should try a lot of at least the way me I could He has always been there for me and my Never had we had to suffer the way he always been a roof on our on our and food in our He may not seem like a big deal to but when I grow up I want to be just like my dad and if possible even very lucky to have a man like that in He has always stuck by my side no My dad has taught me what like to be a All the given me I will never All the told me I hope to pass down to my I want my dad to be for an I look up to my dad because the dad am as a vet because of my love for past experience and my and My passion for is to love them in many them their different out the by good and I am to heal the broken and on the and not only the but the pet In my grown up with all my so I am aware of the into a pet and the right care for that every day I am something new about different species and still want to continue to gain new all my life has also made me want to participate in an actual animal and maybe my own I plan to myself into the new that

them to the most rigid at Court has never the of those Racial and ethnic of any sort are suspect and thus call for the most judicial perception of racial and ethnic is in our and The initial view of the Fourteenth was that was freedom of the slave the and firm of that and the of the freeman and citizen from the of those who had dominion over The Equal was in by judicial It was to of desuetude while the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth a short germinal as a cornerstone in the of property and liberty of New In that the Fourteenth was It was only as the era of substantive due process came to a New West Coast Hotel that the Equal Clause began to attain a genuine measure of ex By that time it was no possible to peg the of the Fourteenth to the struggle for of one racial During the of the Equal the had become a Nation of Each had to to some extent the not of a but of a of various of whom it was in many that a characteristic was a to other As the Nation with the stock of many the reach of the Clause was to all ethnic from official See West supra The of equal said the Court in universal in their to all within the territorial without regard to any of of or of and the equal of the is a pledge of the of equal at Although many of the of the Fourteenth of primary function as the vast between of the race and the white the itself was in universal without to ethnic or condition of prior As this Court in the Civil Act to extend to of racial against white Congress was intent upon in the federal law a principle than would have been necessary simply to meet the particular and immediate plight of the Trail Transportation And that was in to that not would equal under the See it is not that among the were many who would have a of the Equal Clause that a principle of universal and is responsive to the and cultural of the at from class See also The Original and the Over the past this Court has upon the crucial mission of the Equal Clause with the view of to all of equal at in a Nation a legacy of slavery and racial Brown Board of Because the landmark in this area arose in response to the exclusion of from the mainstream of they could be as by the white race against the But they need not be read as upon that for their It to say that the this Court has between because of their as being to a free people whose are upon the doctrine of at us to adopt for the first time a more view of the Equal Clause and hold that against of the white cannot be suspect if purpose can be as The clock of our cannot be back to Brown Board of at at It is far too late to argue that the guarantee of equal to all the of special to a degree of greater than that Fourteenth is not against due to a upon between and at Once the artificial line of a of the Fourteenth is put the in the level of judicial to a status of a particular racial or ethnic are The of and reflect temporary and As the white itself is of various most of which can lay claim to a history of prior at the of the State and private Not all of these can receive preferential and judicial of drawn in of race and for then the only left would be a new of white There is no basis for which would merit judicial and which would would be to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm by various Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of then would be to preferential at the expense of to other Those would be free from judicial As these began to have their and the of past were new judicial would be The kind of variable and analysis necessary to produce such simply not lie within the judicial if they otherwise were feasible and there are serious of justice with the idea of preference it may not always be clear that a preference is in fact may be to validate upon individual of a particular group in order to advance the general See at Nothing in the Constitution the notion that may be to suffer otherwise impermissible in order to enhance the societal of their ethnic preferential may only reinforce common that certain are to achieve success without special on a factor no to individual See there is a measure of inequity in innocent in position to bear the of not of their By the of the Equal Clause to these transitory we would be as a that judicial scrutiny of on racial and ethnic background may vary with the ebb and flow of Disparate of such well may

is to discern absolute to give them throughout the and continuity over significant of and to lift them above the level of the pragmatic of a particular time and The Role of the Supreme Court in If it is the individual who is to judicial against upon his racial or ethnic background because such impinge upon personal rather than the individual only because of his in a particular then may be the necessity for the particular may be in the but the standard of will This is as it should since those are the product of rough compromise struck by within the democratic When they touch upon an race or ethnic he is to a judicial that the burden he is to bear on that basis is to serve a compelling The Constitution that right to every person of his at ex at that on several this Court has preferential

diverse student As the Court in it is not too much to say that the future upon through wide to the and of as diverse as this Nation of many in that must be the right to select those who will contribute the most to the exchange of a that of the First In this must be as to achieve a goal that is of paramount in the of It may be that there is greater force to these at the level than in a school where the is on But even at the graduate our tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of is In at the Court made a similar point with specific to legal law the ground for legal and cannot be in from the and with which the law Few and no one who has law would choose to study in an academic from the of and the exchange of with which the law is serve a heterogeneous An otherwise student with a particular background whether it be or bring to a school of medicine and that the of student body and equip to render with their vital service to Ethnic is only one element in a range of a may consider in the goal of a heterogeneous student Although a must have wide discretion in the sensitive as to who should be individual may not be Respondent and the below have dual is a racial that his under the Fourteenth As the interest of is compelling in the context of a the question whether the racial is necessary to promote this In re at may be that the reservation of a of in each class for from the preferred ethnic would contribute to the of ethnic in the student But argument that this is the only of the interest of is In a most fundamental sense the argument the nature of the state interest that would justify of race or ethnic It is not an interest in simple ethnic in which a percentage of the student body is in effect to be of ethnic with the percentage an of The that a compelling state interest a far array of and of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important special on ethnic would rather than further of genuine Nor would the state interest in genuine be by system into a with a of set aside for each category of it is inconceivable that a would thus pursue the logic of to the end of each category of with certain from competition with all other The experience of other which take race into account in the by the First that the of a of to a group is not a necessary toward that An example is found in the College College has the concept of to include from racial and ethnic College now not only or but also and and other this new definition of has meant that race has been a factor in some admission When the Committee on the large middle group of who are and of good work in their the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his just as origin or a life spent on a farm may tip the balance in other A farm boy from can bring something to College that a cannot a black student can bring something that a white person cannot College the Committee has not set for the of or of football or to be admitted in a given But that not mean that the Committee a minimum of or of people from west of the who are to be It only that in among of who are not only but have other strong the with a of criteria in some attention to distribution among many and of to Brief for and the of as such an race or ethnic background may be a in a particular yet it not insulate the individual from comparison with all other for the The file of a particular black applicant may be for his potential contribution to without the factor of race being decisive when for with that of an applicant as an if the latter is thought to exhibit more to promote beneficial Such could include personal unique work or service a history of to communicate with the or other In an in this way is flexible enough to consider all pertinent of in light of the particular of each and to place them on the same for although not them the same the weight to a particular quality may vary from year to year upon the both of the student body and the for the This kind of each applicant as an individual in the The applicant who out on the last seat to another candidate a on the basis of ethnic background will not have been from all for that seat simply because he was not the right or had the wrong It would mean only that his which may have similar did not those of the other His would have been and and he would have no basis to complain of under the Fourteenth It has been that an which race only as one factor is simply a subtle and more no less of racial preference than the A facial intent to is evident in preference and not in this No such facial in an where race or ethnic background is simply one be against other the boundary as Justice Frankfurter in another none the worse for being And a court would not assume that a to employ a would operate it as a cover for the equivalent of a quota In good faith would be in the of a to the contrary in the permitted by our Metropolitan Swain it is evident that the special the use of an explicit racial never before by this It who are not or that they are from a specific percentage of the in an No how strong their quantitative and their own potential for contribution to they are never the chance to compete with from the preferred for the special At the same the preferred have the to compete for every seat in the The fatal flaw in preferential is of individual as by the Fourteenth at Such are not But when a distribution of or imposition of on ancestry or the of a that individual is to a that the is necessary to promote a substantial state has to carry this For this that of the special invalid under the Fourteenth must be from the race of any the below to that the State has a substantial interest that may be by a the competitive of race and ethnic For this so much of the as from any of the race of any applicant must be respect to to an his admission to the has that it could not carry burden of but for the of special respondent still would not have been respondent is to the and that of the must be TO OPINION OF College the past College has each year for admission that exceed the of in the freshman The of who are to be not is The vast of demonstrate through test high school and that they have the academic to do adequate work at and perhaps to do it with with the dilemma of among a large of the Committee on could use the single criterion of and attempt to determine who among the were to perform best But for the past the Committee on has never this The belief has been that if were the sole or even College would lose a great deal of and intellectual and that the quality of the experience to all would Final of Chairman of the Admission and Committee and Dean of and Financial et those whose intellectual potential will seem extraordinary to the or so out of an class of over Committee in This has in part because it a ingredient to the of the experience The of our experience has to the Committee to be as by a wide variety of and career as it is by a fine faculty and our and belief that an essential ingredient to the process has long been a tenet of College Fifteen or twenty meant from New and city and farm and football and potential and The result was that very few ethnic or racial In College has the concept of to include from racial and ethnic College now not only or but also and and other Contemporary in the mean that if College is to continue to offer a to in the body cannot be by the Committee on In this new definition of has meant that race has been a factor in some admission When the Committee on the large middle group of who are and of good work in their the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his just as origin or a life spent on a farm may tip the balance in other A farm boy from can bring something to College that a cannot a black student can bring something that a white person cannot The quality of the experience of all the in College in part on these in the background and that bring with In College the Committee has not set for the of or of football or to be admitted in a given At the same time the Committee is aware that if College is to provide a truly that the rich of the it cannot be without some attention to It would not make for to have or out of whose are west of the or black could not begin to bring to their and to each other the variety of of and of in the Their small might also create a sense of among the black themselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve their when the Committee on is aware that there is some between and the to be from a diverse student and between and a for those But that not mean that the Committee a minimum of or of people from west of the who are to be It only that in among of who are not only but have other strong the with a of criteria in some attention to distribution among many and of The further help to illustrate the kind of to The with only a few left to might find itself to choose between the child of a successful black physician in an academic with promise of superior academic and a black who grew up in an ghetto of whose academic was but who had energy and as well as an interest in black If a good of black much like A but few like B had already been the Committee might prefer and vice If a white student with extraordinary were also one of the his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and the criteria are often individual or experience not dependent upon race but with of JUSTICE JUSTICE JUSTICE and JUSTICE concurring in the in part and in Court in in part the of the Supreme Court of the power of Federal and State to act to achieve equal for The difficulty of the issue may use to the of past and the mature which each of our Brethren has brought to it have in many no single one for the But this should not and must not mask the central of may take race into account when it not to demean or insult any racial but to remedy cast on by past racial at least when appropriate have been made by or with to act in this THE CHIEF JUSTICE and our and have that Title VI of the Civil Act of as et such as that at the On this statutory theory they would hold that respondent have been and that he be admitted to the Our Brother the although race may be taken into account in the particular special by which in the exclusion of respondent was not shown to be necessary to achieve these of the Court form a of five the of the Supreme Court of insofar as it that respondent to an order that he be admitted to the We agree with JUSTICE as to the case before Title VI goes no further in the use of race than the Equal Clause of the Fourteenth We also agree that the effect of the Supreme of the of the Superior Court of would be to prohibit the from in the future that take race into See at Since we conclude that the affirmative at the School is we would the below in all JUSTICE that some of race in are permissible he with us to make five the below insofar as it the from in the Nation was on the principle that Men are Yet that the of our to forge the into one this principle of with The of this compromise are well known and have been our promise are well known and have been our it is well to how the time has if it has yet when the promise of our has into the of equal for all of race or The Fourteenth the embodiment in the Constitution of our belief in human has been the law of our land for only more than half And for half of that the Equal Clause of the was moribund so as late as Justice could sum up the of that Clause by that it was the of Buck Worse than the Clause was against those whom it was to set them to a but status before the a status always separate but seldom Not until this odious doctrine by our decision in Brown Board of and which that separate and public of all were and forbidden under our Even then inequality was not with deliberate Brown Board of In and again in for we were to school of their to eliminate racial root and And a glance at our docket and at of will show that even today is not a thing of the Against this that law must be or that the datum of race is no relevant to public policy must be seen as rather than as description of This is not to denigrate for us that race has too often been by those who would and oppress Yet we as we shall need not under our Constitution or Title which the of the Fourteenth to private who receive federal become myopia which the that many have been within our as inferior both by the law and by their fellow The threshold question we must decide is whether Title VI of the Civil Act of of federal from preferential to of racial as part of a to such to surmount the by racial We join I and of our Brother opinion and three of us agree with his conclusion in Part II that this case not require us to the question whether there is a private right of under Title In our Title VI only those of racial criteria that would violate the Fourteenth if by a State or it not

this None of these support to the proposition that Congress to bar all to extend the of to who have been from the full of history of Title President that Congress grant executive and to cut off federal to that discriminate against through final of his one to give the Executive Branch of clear to terminate federal of private that use race as a of in a that would be by the Constitution if in

adequate care to It would abuse of food distribution whereby have been known to be food surplus when white were given such It would assure the now only white in of high by Federal It in assure the right to equal in the of Federal It would not destroy any of private property or freedom of was clear to Representative that Title apart from the fact that it all even in the of sufficient state or federal control to invoke the Fourteenth or Fifth was not new substantive upon the use of racial but rather was to extend to such right to equal by under those and he later the purpose of Title VI in this it rather anomalous that the Federal should aid and abet on the basis of or origin by money and other of financial It rather that while we have on the one hand the which is to do away with since it for equal of the on the other we have the Federal and abetting those who persist in racial is for these that we bring forth title The of title VI will serve to specific of law which contemplate Federal to at also a memorandum forth the legal basis for the of Title VI which the theme of his oral to fix the on which Federal will be Congress has power to legislate so as to insure that the Federal not become in a of the at Other of the with Representative that the function of Title VI was to end the Federal complicity in the or exclusion of inconsistent with the to be found in the of the Representative also a member of the Judiciary in the course of why Title VI was that it did not create any new standard of equal beyond that in the the Federal and the are under not to Many have the question as to whether is at not the Executive already have the power in the distribution of Federal to apply those which will the Federal itself to live up to the mandate of the Constitution and to require and local to live up to the most the and at then that was to the of by the Executive Branch because to contemplate the expenditure of to support The of and the purpose and function of Title VI were by other and of the in the Nowhere is there any suggestion that Title VI was to terminate federal for any reason other than of race or origin by the recipient institution in a inconsistent with the in the The of Title VI an identical the purpose and scope of the the Senate floor the Senate debate with a analysis of the Civil Act in which he the purpose of Title purpose of title VI is to make sure that of the are not to support racial In many the of or which title VI to are This is so wherever Federal go to a State which in racial It may also be so where Federal go to support under the decision in Cone Memorial In all such is contrary to and to the moral sense of the title VI is simply to insure that Federal are spent in with the Constitution and the moral sense of the at in in the that was to accomplish this because it was necessary to eliminate the power of federal to terminate financial to in racial in the face of various federal which to to Although that Title VI conduct because of insufficient might be beyond the reach of the it was clear to him that the substantive standard by the statute was that of the Fifth and Fourteenth Senate of Title VI with description of the as the explicit and to apply the of the Constitution to all of federal the function of Title there is a against in the use of Federal and title VI simply out the procedure to be in that at strong of the in the Senate their intent to assure that federal would only be spent in with See of at at at contention that Congress Title VI to bar to by the of to participate in is also by an examination of the type of conduct which Congress thought it was by of Title The that the was by a desire to eradicate a very specific federal financial support of which by them from or them with separate Again

and the at also the of The conclusion to be drawn from the is Congress that in some with congressional were being against in the of and the full of federal financial It was aware that there were many and which against in a inconsistent with the of the Fifth and Fourteenth but whose might not involve sufficient state or federal so as to be in of these Congress that it was whether the Executive Branch legal to terminate the of on the ground that they against in a of the in the Fourteenth and Fifth solution was to end the complicity in forbidden racial by the Executive Branch with the and the to terminate financial support of any which racial criteria in a by the Of it might be that the Congress which Title VI the Constitution to require strict racial or and then that concept as a rule of statutory Later interpretation and of the Constitution to permit use of race would then not Title prohibition of But there are three compelling to reject such a no decision of this Court has the proposition that the Constitution must be See at even if it could be in that the Constitution might require Congress would not have chosen to codify such a view the Constitution The history of Title as well as the statute a desire to induce voluntary with the of See of the at It is inconceivable that Congress to voluntary to eliminate the evil of racial while at the same time forbidding the voluntary use of to cure or obvious statutory Yet a of Title VI as all upon race which any individual would require guilty of to await the imposition of such by the Executive such an interpretation of Title VI would of federal from race into account even when necessary to bring their into with federal This would be a of a statute to eliminate in light of judicial that under certain the use of racial criteria is not only permissible but is to eradicate For in Board of the Court held that a statute forbidding the of on the basis of race was because it would the implementation of necessary to accomplish the of a school as the race of must be in whether a has so also must race be in a at Congress did not intend to prohibit the use of racial criteria when or to terminate the of any entity which such a It to all the use of necessary to eliminate racial in of the Constitution rather than the recipient to await a judicial of and the judicial imposition of a the history that Congress any static definition of in of broad language that could be by and judicial Although it is clear from the that the of Title VI to ban of race by the Constitution more the maintenance of they never the term or what an exclusion from or a denial of on the ground of This failure was not lost upon word as in this has no contextual explanation other than the provision that the to be in or from and on the ground With this the by this only when an individual is or because of his or What or Section and section of title VI do not They leave the of that question to the executive or each without any guideline whatever to point out what is the congressional also of Representative Representative Despite these the to include in the statute or even provide in debate a more explicit definition of what Title VI The explanation for this failure is Specific were in the of the principal because Title standard was that of the Constitution and one that could and should be and See of there was a strong emphasis throughout of Title VI on the Executive Branch with in and the prohibition against racial Attorney General that had not been written into the itself because the and might differ from one to another so that the term would assume different in different This to in the of Title VI was by the When an that would have federal to take race into account in children in adoptive and foster the which was by a on the ground that federal could be to act and that there was no danger that they would prohibit the use of racial criteria under such at not to incorporate a static definition of into Title VI is not In and when Title VI was and the had only the Equal Clause to strike down public racial in and the scope of that principle was in a state of flux and rapid Many such as whether the Fourteenth only de jure or in at least some de facto had not yet an authoritative judicial The congressional debate an of the evolutionary change that law in the area of racial was in In of Title prohibition with the of the Fifth and Fourteenth refusal to define that racial which it to and expectation that the statute would be in a flexible compel the conclusion that Congress the of the prohibition to evolve with the interpretation of the of the any claim that the use of racial criteria is by the plain language of the statute must fail in light of the purpose of Title VI and The cryptic nature of the language in Title VI concern with the use of racial as a of or and to prohibit such We have held that aid to of the of as in the is there can be no of which however clear the may appear on Train Public Interest This is so as is the case the literal of what is to be the plain language of the that it is so would lead to in direct conflict with Section of Title federal to promulgate Title These under the of the require Presidential are to in Title Family Red Lion it is most significant that the of and Welfare which much of the federal to of has affirmative to racial

preferential in behalf of racial It would be difficult to explain from the language of Title much less from why the statute where a recipient institution has in past but such where racial as a result of the of past by other than the are from the of HEW was fully aware of the incongruous nature of such an interpretation of Title Title in the of such prior a recipient in a may take affirmative to

that the of a statute by those with execution is of respect where Congress has attention to the and left it Red Lion at Congress took just this kind of when it an to the of and and Welfare bill for which would have the use of race in by the The as submitted by Representative that of the in this Act may be to carry out or any of affirmative or any other system of or in regard to admission or which or require any on the basis of sex or In support of the Representative that the Civil Act never the imposition of affirmative and that this was a of the at He that he permitting to adopt to

of and Welfare which for of with any or other to or sex any individual or entity to take any with respect to the or promotion or of such individual or or the or of such individual or at was by the The Senate no such upon to impose and the Conference upon the of the Secretary of the House provision from the More significant for is the fact that even the of upon implementation of Title VI did not challenge the right of to extend to racial congressional to the passage of Title VI any possible doubt about the of racial for the purpose of racial It that Congress did not intend to prohibit and not now believe that Title VI the of race as part of a remedy for societal even where there is no that the institution the preference has been guilty of past nor any judicial that the particular of the racial preference have been by societal Just last year Congress that no shall be made any local public project the applicant satisfactory assurance to the Secretary that at least per centum of the amount of each grant shall be for business The statute the term business as at least per centum of which is by group in case of a at least per centum of the stock of which is by group The term group is in racial of the who are and Although the statute an exemption from this the extent that the Secretary this escape clause was only to deal with the that certain of the country might not contain sufficient business to permit with the quota of the The history of this that it a deliberate attempt to deal with the excessive rate of among and to the of controlled It was that such a was in order to still on the and to compete with and more which would always be successful in What is most significant about the congressional of the measure is that although the use of a racial quota or by a recipient of federal would constitute a direct of Title VI if that statute were read to prohibit no mention was made during the in either the House or the Senate of even the that the quota for might in any way conflict with or modify Title It is inconceivable that such a conflict would have congressional attention through an inadvertent failure to the of Title the Act of which this provision is a part also a provision on the basis of sex which that this prohibition be through and similar to those already with respect to racial and other under Title VI of the Civil Act of Thus Congress was fully aware of the of Title VI to the of public Under these the of the for a congressional that the use of race is permissible under Title We have that an interpretation of an Act is to great weight in the of the Red Lion at See also of this Court also suggest that Title VI not prohibit the use of race where such is In the Court held that the failure of the school system to provide to of ancestry who do not speak or to provide them with in a of Title The Court upon an HEW which that a recipient of federal not criteria or of which have the effect of to or have effect of or of the of the as

significant in two it that in at least some responsible for the of Title VI may require who have not been guilty of any to depart from a policy of and to be of the impact of their upon racial that federal be latitude in to remedy the exclusion of significant of from the of Although this Court has not yet the by analogy to our Title a school would not be in of Title VI under because of the serious under of racial in student body as long as it could demonstrate that with the performance of in school and the It would be inconsistent with and the emphasis of Title VI and the HEW on voluntary to require that an institution wait to be to be in of the law before being permitted to upon a and belief that the failure of certain racial to satisfy is not a measure of their ultimate performance as but a result of the of past societal We that when read in light of our decision in which the general proposition that is because it has a may be read as being upon the view at least under some Title VI conduct which might not be by the Since we are now of the for the set forth that Title applicable alike to public and private of federal is no than the we have serious the of what to be the premise of that even that impact alone is in some sufficient to establish a prima of Title contrary to our view that Title definition of racial is coextensive with the this would not assist the respondent in the for the at of whether Title extend beyond the the to the the proposition that Congress to prohibit of federal from to eliminate the of past societal against racial such as for the set forth in the the view that voluntary is permissible under Title If discriminatory racial impact alone is enough to demonstrate at least a prima Title VI it is difficult to believe that the Title would forbid the School from to correct the exclusionary of initial policy during the first two of the The Court has also to adopt a interpretation of other similar to that in Title We have held under Title VII that where have a impact upon racial they constitute a statutory even in the of discriminatory the is able to demonstrate that the are to the of the More the Court has that be given by to of racial as a remedy for past of Title even where there has been no that the has with a discriminatory we have the Act of et which a provision any procedure or that or right of any citizen of the

the expense of These prior are of the to construe to eliminate against racial in a which would impede to attain this There is no for from this course in the case of Title VI and the clear of Congress that is We to our analysis of the Equal Clause of the Fourteenth of human is with the proposition that in or birth or are neither significant nor relevant to the way in which should be the position that such must be an up by the shorthand phrase Constitution is has never been by this Court as the proper of the Equal we have this proposition on a of Our have always that an statutory could be

our prior analytic framework for race not mean that it should be by the very loose standard of that is the very least that is always in equal mere of a compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which against any inquiry into the actual a statutory a of in but which carry even more force when to racial us to conclude that racial to further serve important and must be to of those at too often

conclusion that also may adopt to chronic under where there is reason to believe that the evil is a product of past racial Title VII was pursuant to power under the Commerce Clause and of the Fourteenth To the extent that Congress under the Commerce Clause it was in the use of race in by the equal component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth to the same extent as are the by of the Fourteenth to the extent that Title VII on the Commerce Clause our such as and that the affirmative use of race is consistent with the equal component of the Fifth and therefore with the Fourteenth To the extent that Congress pursuant to of the Fourteenth those that Congress was under that provision to accord preferential to of past in order to the of and we see no reason to conclude that the cannot accomplish under of the Fourteenth what Congress under of the Fourteenth may or compel either the or private to A contrary position would conflict with the the of the to initiate consistent

that goal of admitting by the of past is important to justify use of our prior show that a state may adopt if the purpose of such is to the disparate racial impact might otherwise have and if there is reason to believe that the disparate impact is itself the product of past whether own or that of society at There is no question that is valid under this on the basis of the factual before this had a

this I am to assume an affirmative If in fact no private cause of this Court and the as well are without jurisdiction to consider Title VI As I see if we are not to do it is at least advisable to address this threshold See just as it is inappropriate to address without whether statutory before us are it is at least practice to adjudicate a novel and difficult statutory issue without first whether we have jurisdiction to decide I address the question of whether respondent may bring suit under Title A private cause of under Title in both of the Civil Act as a whole and that would not be with the of the and would be contrary to the Title et with public and Title et with proscribe private discriminatory conduct that as of neither the Constitution nor other federal had been to Both for private as well as for official in Title et and Title et with public and public by the Attorney General to eliminate racial in these Because to end in public and public were already under it of to provide for private under III and But each Title that for public would not affect private and The role of Title VI was to terminate federal financial support for public and private or that on the basis of Section the proscription that no on the of or was to be from or against under any or federal financial But there is no express provision for private to Title and it would be quite incredible if so to the of private in other of the to create a private cause of to Title It is also evident from the face of that Congress the and to define and to by rule or the general proscription of subject only to judicial of in with Section for Every federal or financial support is to implement the proscription by appropriate rule or each of which approval by the of as a sanction for is but only a and the failure of voluntary to secure may not take place until the or with the appropriate of the House and Senate a full written of the and the for such and have Judicial was at least for financial of

short circuit the procedural in Title If the Federal may not cut off except pursuant to an by the and to the appropriate committee of Congress for a and voluntary to achieve have it is inconceivable that Congress to permit to circumvent these although Congress Title VI to end federal financial support for discriminatory of not only public but also private and it is that without a word that it to do an private statutory cause of against all private as well as public that might be in of the There is no doubt that Congress private as an important tool to attack discriminatory It not at all that Congress new private under Title VI Wherever a discriminatory was a public such as a public private were already under other and a private remedy under Title VI was Congress was well aware of this there was frequent to Cone Memorial throughout the congressional held that under appropriate the of a private hospital with use of public and extensive in the common for the of the Fourteenth at It was of to create a Title VI private against private where they were already within the reach of private But when they were that by the federal or state the beneficiary in is difficult to believe that Congress a private remedy to terminate conduct that had been beyond the reach of federal For those who contrary to my that Title VI was to create a standard of than the Constitution itself the result of no private cause of even more In that case Congress must be seen to have of as well as of not by A Congress careful enough to provide that private of would be would not leave for inference a vast new extension of private And a Congress so with the satisfaction of procedural before fund with the choice of a cutoff or of would not permit private to pose that same dilemma in a category of with no procedural in at least three who a major role in the passage of Title VI that a private right of under Title VI not As an of explicit or either to create such a remedy or to deny at cannot be and under explicit purpose to deny such cause of at for a private to for the from but the of Justice to include and the These are not ambiguous They indicate the of a intent to create a private Nor do any of these make nice between a private cause of to and one to cut off as JUSTICE and the three who join his opinion See at it would be odd if they since the practical effect of either type of private cause of would be If private to conduct of were of federal would be with the choice of either what the rather than the to be a discriminatory practice within the of Title VI or federal and thereby from the This is the same choice as would confront if suit were brought to cut off Both of would the so into the This Court has always the inference of such a private cause of not otherwise by the statute must be consistent with the evident intent of with the of the to be by the Railroad Passenger of Railroad See also Investor A private cause of under Title VI is to satisfy either prong of this Because each of my either has a different view or a private cause of the of the Title VI issue must be My in that as well as my with respect to the equal are in the joint opinion that my and and I

remedy the of by to race in an effort to increase the and percentage of Court long ago any fair and just of any section or phrase of these it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the spirit of them the evil which they were to remedy at is plain that the Fourteenth was not to prohibit to remedy the of the past of The Congress that the Fourteenth is the same Congress that the Bureau an Act that many of only to Act of see at Although the Bureau aid for thereby white within some of the relief see also Act of the bill was to the of many as and for the and to the exclusion of

Congress that and the to the Bureau Act special relief to also the Fourteenth it is inconceivable that the Fourteenth was to prohibit all relief It be a of the policy in that which was to state to perpetuate on the basis of race or Railway Mail to hold that it state to remedy the of that Such a result would pervert the intent of the by abstract for the genuine the was to has been in our joint

that is the very target of all at Only last in we upheld a New plan that was drawn on the basis of race to enhance the electoral power of and the plan had the effect of the electoral strength of the We were in to sanction the use of a racial even though it otherwise In another case last the Court upheld a provision in the Social that against men because purpose was permissible one of our longstanding disparate of at We thus the of past societal through the use of otherwise Nothing in those that a cannot act to remedy past It is true that in both and the use of the was on or but in neither case had those made that there had been or that the specific to be had been the of the in each of those was on a that the group was in need of the remedy because of some type of past There is thus ample support for the conclusion that a can employ to remedy past societal without the need for a that those were of that I applaud the of the Court that a may consider race in it is more than a little ironic several hundred of against the Court is to hold that a remedy for that is In to so the fact that for several hundred have been not as but rather because of the of their It is in to have individual demonstrate that they have been of racial the of our society has been so pervasive that of wealth or has to escape The experience of in has been different in not just in from that of other ethnic It is not the history of slavery alone but also that a whole people were as inferior by the And that mark has The dream of as the great pot has not been for the because of his skin he never even made it into the These in the experience of the make it difficult for me to accept that cannot be greater under the Fourteenth where it is necessary to remedy the of past In the Civil the Court wrote that the from slavery must cease be the special of the at see at We cannot in light of the history of the last century yield to that Had the Court in that decision and been to for human liberty and the fundamental of what it did for the of slavery and the of the of fugitive at we would not need now to permit the of any Most had the Court been in in to hold that the Equal Clause in on we would not be with this dilemma in We must that the principle that the is only in the opinion of the lone at The of the Court the principle of and for the next from to Brown Board of was a Nation by an individual could be given on the of his It is because of a legacy of that we now must permit the of this society to give to race in about who will hold the of and prestige in For far too the to those have been shut to If we are to become a fully one in which the of a skin will not determine the to him or we must be to take to open those I do not believe that anyone can truly look into past and still find that a remedy for the of that past is It has been said that this case only the and this I that there is a of the of and that may be by the decision in this For we are told by the Attorney General of the that at least federal have of federal to take to the of which in by of a particular or Brief for as I cannot even guess the of state and local that have set up which may be by I fear that we have come full the Civil War our several This Court in the Civil and the toward complete For almost a century no was and this was with the tacit approval of the Then we had Brown Board of and the Civil of by numerous we have this Court again this time to stop of the type by the of JUSTICE participate of in the that the of my and I add only some general that hold particular for and then a few on equal At least until the only a very small less than of the and and law in the were of what we now refer to as In of our were at only two If are not found to remedy that the country can never achieve goal of a society that is not race I yield to no one in my earnest hope that the time will come when an is and in only a relic of the I would hope that we could reach this stage within a decade at the But the story of Brown Board of almost a of a century that that hope is a slim At some beyond any period of what some would claim is only the must and will reach a stage of where along this line is no Then will be as and of the type we address today will be an ugly feature of history that is but that is behind The of indeed for admission to in the far the of Wholly apart from racial and ethnic the process in the denial of admission to many to far more than the of those who are it is a denial to the This inescapable fact is brought into sharp focus here because is not himself with and yet is the one who is and because the School of the of at itself is not with One solution to the need for more in would be to our graduate Then all who and were could and talk of would this is neither feasible nor The vast that would be simply are not And the need for more in the strict perhaps has not been at There is no particular or real in the division at The same and would apply to the case if special had on any that on or or on only It is somewhat ironic to have us so over a where race is an element of and yet to be aware of the as we that of albeit more on the than the graduate

Fourteenth are racial and ethnic where they are are suspect and call for judicial academic freedom is a special concern of the First and the Fourteenth has beyond original concept and now is to have a point as JUSTICE at from the opinion in Trail it a This not mean for that the Fourteenth has broken away from and original Those original And in a distinct is what in the face of proper is all If this with that tension is original Fourteenth and and it is part of the very nature until complete is in the In this equal is a I in particular that the are not to be of are not on but neither are they off Racial have been given in the school in the in and in To be some of these may be on the ground that was But who is to say that is not for some of although it is of a and perhaps different The in of their and I rather doubt that they regard the there as one that was the to as JUSTICE at And in we to I am not as JUSTICE to that the between the and the one by is very profound or The line between the two is a thin and indistinct In is at Because of my that admission are for the I am to accept the that the is one where good faith in is as well as I agree that such a where race or ethnic background is only one of many is a than The of may say that under a such as one may accomplish what it I need not go that for despite the for is within though perhaps It is free of as in I am not to infer a It is worth that preference has not been a to our legal We see it in We see it in the We see it in the progressive income We see it in the We may excuse some of these on the ground that they have specific as with that those are of the these exist and may not be And in the as I have have always athletic financial alumni and other of that I add these only as on the of the central question as to which I join my and in our more general It is to know that the Court at least it for an academic institution to take race and ethnic background into as one among in the of I presume that that factor always has been though perhaps not or even It is a fact of and a part of the real world of which we are all a The we get down the road toward and being a part of the real and not it out and away from the will these vanish from the I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an in a neutral way and have it To ask that this be so is to demand the In order to get beyond we must first take account of There is no other And in order to treat some we must treat them We dare the Equal Clause perpetuate racial So the ultimate as it was at the beginning of this Among the how one A long time as time is for this a Chief both wise and this we must never that it is a constitution we are the same the Great Chief Justice further the end be let it be within the scope of the and all which are which are to that which are not but consist with the and spirit of the are at one to become a Justice of this Court great of the constitution have a content and a that vary from age to The Nature of the Judicial Process And an who became a President of the the Constitution of the is not a mere it is a vehicle of and spirit is always the spirit of the in the of breadth and and are basic to our we are a The same that case in govern case in There can be no other JUSTICE with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE concurring in the in part and in It is always important at the to focus on the controversy before the It is important to do so in this case because correct of the will determine whether it is necessary or appropriate to express any opinion about the legal status of any other than is not a class The controversy is between two specific special that it him a place in school because of his race in of the Federal and and of Title VI of the Civil Act of et The Supreme Court upheld his challenge and him If the state court was correct in view that the special was and that was therefore from the School because of his we should affirm of our about the of that are not now before the The as by the trial court four separate two of which are of Paragraph that the special the Fourteenth the State and Title The trial court did not order the to admit because it that had not shown that he would have been admitted if there had been no special in paragraph of it the to consider for admission without regard to his race or the race of any other The order did not include any broad prohibition against any use of race in the were to the of Because the has since been to admit paragraph of the trial order no has any The Supreme in a that is not that the trial court the burden on of that he would have been admitted in the of The then it not meet the burden of that the special did not result in failure to be the Supreme Court the trial court to enter Since that order paragraph of the trial there is no forbidding any of racial criteria in It is therefore clear that the question whether race can be as a factor in an decision is not an issue in this and that discussion of that issue is and respondent have us to determine the of the special by to the Our is to avoid the decision of a issue if a case can be on a statutory there is one doctrine more than any other in the process of it is that we ought not to pass on of such is Motor The more important the the more force there is to this In this we are with a question of and a statutory claim was at the very inception of this and in the of the trial court by the Supreme it is our plain duty to confront Only if should prevail on the statutory issue would it be necessary to decide whether the the Equal Clause of the Fourteenth of the Civil Act of person in the on the ground of or be from be the or be to under any or Federal financial through special from in of because of his The also that it and still federal financial The plain language of the statute therefore of the A different result cannot be that language the actual intent of the Congress that the statute or the statute is not enforceable in a private Neither conclusion is Title VI is an integral part of the Civil Act of No when this was being Congress was not with the of or attention was on the problem at the against which throughout our with respect to Title the federal of The genesis of the did not limit the breadth of the solution Just as Congress to the problem of by a provision that all see Trail answer to the problem of of as a broad prohibition against the exclusion of any individual from a the ground of In the of the House Title VI for general principle that no person be from on the ground of or origin under any or Federal financial This same broad view of Title VI and was throughout the congressional debate and was by every one of the major spokesmen for the that exclusion of on the basis of race not violate Title VI if the exclusion with it no racial No such or of prohibition of is by the statute or The language of the entire section is the that follow do not modify or qualify the explicit of any exclusion on the The history this The only suggestion that would allow exclusion of non came from of the and then only by way of a discussion of the of the word The that the term would be read as racial and and and they for a specific definition of the term in order to avoid this In the of the gave that the Act would be in the Senate floor for the this position as word has been in many a court What it in the bill is a in given to different because of their different religion or answer to this question is that if race is not a we do not have to worry about because of The Internal Revenue Code not provide that people do not have to pay or that they can pay their later than everyone we to treat as not as fat thin short tall brown green yellow or white but as If we did that we would not need to worry about at In such as it clear that the of Title VI that the Constitution itself a standard on the part of but that not mean that the only an The statutory prohibition against in in is more than a simple of what the Fifth or Fourteenth would The Title VI consistent with their view of the Constitution and they sought to provide an weapon to implement that As a of what the of the Act the Constitution of State and Federal has independent with language and emphasis in addition to that found in the As with other of the Civil expression of policy to end racial may proscribe conduct that the Constitution we need not decide the lack of the controlling statute and the Constitution since the of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal Race cannot be the basis of anyone from in a In nothing in the history the conclusion that the broad language of should not be given natural We are with a distinct statutory at a particular time with particular in neither language nor any prior interpretation that place in the Civil won long is simply that of a In the Act the exclusion of from because of their As during the Senate under Title VI it is not to say to one but to say to another

establish a people here are lost and a fact that light on the standard propaganda line that we have to teach democracy to But although feel that people have too little only feel that way about while twice that feel that have too much These reflect yet another victory for corporate The human of the are Take of home aid for the which had over million have below and spend over of that on energy Even with federal half the had up the before in and by twice as many had from the cold wave as in the City Hospital found that among children in the room the percentage malnutrition almost in the The new will not only harm or kill more but are also a useful blow to The oil with the were small often So the threat of democracy is back another Another target is public trivial but an important part of the campaign to some public support by a show of on the part of those who are the public under The propaganda campaign to depict the public system as and is It is whether it has had much A poll that over of the want to keep the public But the idea that any element of the information system might within a democratic system has always been to the totalitarian so despite it may Also for demolition is the

extraordinary in a small of and another contribution to The collapse is just another in a series of Orange and casino The will be paid by the usual It hasn't been easy for to deal with One problem has been to reconcile the concept of a with the fact that the public it almost every step of the and to the doctrine that like the White is to the public New already that the public key of the but that Congress the that the public on their of public Congress has to notice what the have The doctrinal system of but not of service to dominant honesty would be as a were anyone so bold as to Some keep to conceal the Thus we find with such as agenda is that only of have even heard of the Contract with and a third of the in the Post some of the are term for a budget and welfare is the fact that term were advocacy of a budget to small if it in social as of course it and while the public oppose been fed wild about it help for the the even appear in to confirm the official A lead story in the New in us that Like we find which show quite the about the has a to take care of the while a mere support a decrease in for poor one of the major of the On the which is to have popular the that the were if are in on and Social as they would of course In The real By the time the budget hit the front in late the issue had been by fiat to social with the crucial issue of general social and popular about the in of that the public the The correspondent responsible for analysis of the about the by the who are and to avoid the himself only a mention of military and social Democrat Kerry how hard it was for him to vote against the of the are don't pass an that will require in Without any to the manufacture of image will become and the should to be able to use the public opposition to their actual stand on this issue as a powerful propaganda large oppose specific that are being with rare One can only speculate as to how people would were they to read small in the Wall Journal out the of the to ease the burden of estate and gift which they say are onerous for small and family and which the top tax official of the Treasury will cut over billion in tax in ten about half of of the The of fact with doctrine arise in the arena as It was impossible to conceal the fact that the on which the propaganda campaign was was utter as was to anyone with even a casual interest in the that this was the of the miracle of the market to the World Bank and the the elite and other Also difficult to handle is the fact that the taxpayer is the of off a mint on the risky they are not to pay the under any more than their To steer through this maze some Thus under the headline Risk to Foster Free New Lewis that the might lead some be about a mechanism that would provide for the rich in case go but a more serious look that if had the crisis have the model that has become this economic signature for the at In both the for and a few public and the way the were are of free Part IV a Utopia of the The

colonial though a brutal imperial quite from the Western Within the region by and the financial have been powerful enough to capital as well as to control the rest of the they have not been by what economic historian the most extraordinary myth of is difficult to find another case where the so contradict a dominant theory than the one the impact of he much of the though the of state intervention for the because he himself to a narrow category of market The of have been by the of which is why they have while those to their have The official tale is that the region is to We even read that of many in the term here for to the brutal and corrupt in but not to the people for the right to and In internal we find greater Thus a Federal economic growth to a domestic policy and other state in than in the but as the and that fact has to be in the context of the much of work in the and the social contract While the work week is postwar the battle for a week been lost long in it has fallen to

plantation in which male seven of paternal The same picture is by of guaranteeing The has by far the worst in the Western hemisphere and with the exception of El and It not even standard on child and the right to The major that have led to the global economic crisis are well One is the of which has the The business press the Western that they must abandon their life and such as health and safety

inequality and other that the Bank as essential for and There is ample For over have been by the powerful the of economic with uniform for the and their power for the are to draw no A second factor in the general crisis is the huge explosion of financial capital since the system was by and the radical change in turnover on foreign exchange may be some In the about of capital in was for and for By those had and a estimate is that only is to economic The were In his presidential address to the laureate that be to slow down if would drive the world a with as By the point is a commission by
