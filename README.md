## CSSS admin
**Describe briefly your idea**
We are using spotify data to explore cultural trends, in the CSSS cohort, and also in the general population. The focus is to learn and create cool data visualizations and maybe make some cool findings on the way. 

**Do you have a research question? (It's ok if the answer is "not yet")**
(See above)

**What is everyone's role in the group?**
Ben: API coding and visualization help. 90-10, CSSS-after.
Simone: passive learning, some questions.
Zach: coding and viz. No data collection. 90-10, CSSS-after. 
Elise: coding, data analysis, personal questions. Summer school data collection. Will to continue after. 
Lena: peripheral, interested in CSSS collection. 
Mery: admin guru + leading. 

**What do you expect to achieve by the end of summer school?**
1. Data collection on CSSS cohort
2. Visualization of a couple of smaller projects.
